# Titanic-EDA-and-ML

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset, showcasing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** implementations.

## Analysis Steps

### 1. **Data Loading**
   - Import the dataset and necessary libraries.

### 2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values and correct data types.

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize data distributions.
   - Analyze relationships between features and survival.

### 4. **Feature Engineering**
   - Create new features and prepare data for modeling.

### 5. **Model Building**
   - Split data into training and testing sets.
   - Train machine learning models.
   - Evaluate model performance.

## Results

The analysis provides insights into factors influencing survival and presents a predictive model with an accuracy of approximately **80%**.
